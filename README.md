# Private-School-CMS
This front-end project was developed as an assignment for AFDEmp.

The project required the use of HTML/CSS.
I added JavaScript and jQuery in order to use modals and to mimic the fetch of data using fake JSON objects.


## Requirements
In short, the requirements were that the user should see the pages for the following actions:

- Create/Read/Update/Delete Courses, Trainers, Students, Assignments.
- Create/Read/Update/Delete Trainers per Course, Students per Course, Assignments per Course, Trainers per Course
- Create/Read/Update/Delete Assignments per Student per Course
- Apply validation of inputs

## Deployment
Please open with VSCode live server.


## Future updates
To turn it into a fully functional web app using REST API and connection to MySQL database.
